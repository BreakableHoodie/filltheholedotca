# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest production deployment of **fillthehole.ca** is actively supported. There are no versioned releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting instead — it keeps the details confidential until a fix is ready:

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/BreakableHoodie/filltheholedotca/security/advisories/new) tab
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Describe the issue, reproduction steps, and potential impact

We aim to acknowledge reports within **72 hours** and to ship a fix within **14 days** for confirmed issues, depending on severity.

## Scope

Reports are welcome for vulnerabilities in this codebase, including:

- **Injection** — SQL injection, XSS (e.g. unsanitised content in Leaflet popups), command injection
- **Authentication / authorisation bypass** — accessing or modifying data beyond what the public API allows
- **Data exposure** — unintended disclosure of location data, IP hashes, or confirmation records
- **Rate-limit / geofence bypass** — circumventing the abuse-prevention controls on the report endpoint
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** — critical CVEs in direct dependencies with a realistic attack path

Out of scope:

- Reports generated by automated scanners with no demonstrated exploit
- Denial-of-service attacks (we are a small volunteer project)
- Missing security headers with no realistic impact
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without a proof-of-concept

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure model. Once a fix is deployed, we are happy to credit you in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
